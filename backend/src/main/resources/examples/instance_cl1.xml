        <sp:paragraph>
            The zebra finch (Poephila guttata) is a sexually dimorphic, social estrildid native to the grasslands of Australia.
            They are opportunistic, year-round breeders which nest in colonies of variable size.
            Zebra finches form permanent pair bonds and both sexes share the responsibilities of nest building, incubation and rearing of young (Walter, 1973).
            Morris (1954), however, reported that although both sexes pick up and nibble on fragments of material, males collect most of the nesting material.

                The zebra finches used in this study were in three colonies in the lab of Dr. J.R. Baylis at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
                Each colony contained between thirty and forty individual birds of both sexes, a variety of ages and several plumage types.
                All animals wore colored leg bands for individual identification and all had been exposed to grass, green embroidery floss and white dog fur as nesting material previous to this study.
                The colonies were housed in separate rooms, each approximately 17m3 and each contained eight artificial nest boxes.
                All behavioral observations were made from outside the colony rooms through one-way mirrors.

            <sp:paragraph>
                The results from these experiments suggest that zebra finches do in fact have color preferences with regard to nesting material.
                Contrary to the predictions made by generalizing Burleyâ€™s studies (1981, 1982), however, the zebra finches used in this study preferred green, red or black nesting material to orange.
                These results are similar to those of Collias and Collias (1981) who showed that weaver birds preferred green nesting material. [0]
