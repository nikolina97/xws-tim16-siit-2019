		We believe that the problem to progress in OMR for CWMN lies in the complexity involved in
		correctly modeling the composition of musical symbols. Unlike these hand-engineered multi-stage
		approaches, we propose a holistic strategy in which the musical notation is learned as a whole using
		machine learning strategies. However, to reduce the complexity to a feasible level, we do consider
		a first initial stage in which the image is pre-processed to find and separate the different staves of the
		score. Staves are good basic units to work on, analogously to similar text recognition where a single
		line of text is assumed as input unit. Note that this is not a strong assumption as there are successful
		algorithms for isolating staves, as mentioned above.
